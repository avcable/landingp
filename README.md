Landing page
My first ever attempt at building a webpage from scratch. I aim here to exhibit what I've learned in the CSS and Flexbox modules and use divs and spans to edit and format the page as necessary.

I chose to focus on a local cat shelter where I volunteer. All photos in this assignment are photos I took while volunteering. To find out more information about the shelter, send me an email -- in the meantime, I'm going to change their information to maintain their privacy (at least, until I get the go-ahead from them that I can publish this with their information).

My CSS could certainly be consolidated, which I will aim to fix in future publications.
